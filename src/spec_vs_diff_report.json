      "reason": "Although the main sim view no longer shows a Google Maps gating UI, the diff still contains Google Maps integration modules and API-key access utilities (and they are modified, not removed). From the diff summary alone, it is not verifiable that the app no longer reads/requires VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, nor that Google Maps endpoint requests cannot occur during gameplay (even if the new scene uses procedural terrain).",
